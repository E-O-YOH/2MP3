Minesweeper terminal game to introduce students to programming in C. In a Linux terminal, the program can be compiled with the GCC compiler and executed. Once executed the user can play the game as normal with 15 bombs randomly spread over the 10x10 board. The user chooses tiles turn by turn in the terminal with the board displayed each time until they either lose by hitting a bomb or win by uncovering every square without a bomb.
